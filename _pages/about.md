**Hello, and welcome to my About page!** I am a recent college graduate from The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, and hold a bachelors degree in Actuarial Science. I genuinenly love the study of Mathematics, but am specifically interested in recursion and the applied topics of Statistics and Operations Research.\
Although it is globally understood that toning in your math skills is a *top-notch passtime*, I have to admit that in my freetime I'm a bit of an Outdoorsman. Whether it be fishing, hiking, or just simply hanging out on the back deck, I take every oppurtunity I get to clear my head, breathe some fresh air, and photosynthesize!\
My inabillity to sit still also leads me to be quite the hobbiest. The most recent one being leatherworking, and before that was an online reselling business I operated fully out of my garage.\
Yea, I know, random right?\
\
Anywho, the sole purpose of this page is simply to be an outlet for the hobby of mine in which I want to become my career. If you cannot tell by now, I would like to keep the nature of this portfolio a little less formal than it should be, and maybe a little too transparent as well. At the current time that this "About" page is being written, I have only been coding for a little less than a month. With that being said, being self-taught sometimes feels like trying to drink from a water hose and can be very discouraging at times since people tend to only post their best work and harldy ever disclose the journey it took them to get there.\
**So feel free to come along with me on the unglamorous and unfiltered journey of an aspiring Data Scientist.**
