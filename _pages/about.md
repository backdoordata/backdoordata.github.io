<!-- # <span style="font-size:1.3em;">"Hello World!"</span>
I am a recent college graduate from The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, I have a B.S. in Actuarial Science, and I'm an aspiring Data Scientist! While I was in undergrad, the topics that excited me the most were Statistics, Operations Research, and Matrix Theory. My passions are in mathematics, solving puzzles, and I love to build and create things. Although it is indisputable that performing statistical analyses and finding data trends are *top-tier passtimes*, some of my other hobbies include fishing, hiking, and leatherworking!  
  
Shortly following graduation in early January of 2020, I wrote my first line of code -- I've been entirely self taught thus far. I'd be lying if I said it was as easy as all the people on the forums and YouTube make it out to be. It's quite challenging, easily discouraging, and with the enormous amount of readily accessible information, it can feel like trying to take a drink of water from a fire hose.

**<center>Thanks for stopping by! I'll try to keep this short, sweet, and to the point.</center>**
  
**Who am I?**  
Well, I was born and raised in Jackson, a small town in West Tennessee, and I've been living in East Tennessee for the past four years. I recently graduated from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in December of 2019 with a 3.3 GPA, and a Bachelor's in Actuarial Science. My friends and family consider me to be a hobbiest, and it's probably because I'd much rather be making something or learning something new than sit on the couch watching the TV. From researching, to fishing, to studying up on the latest tech, to leatherworking and laser cutting, I love to do it all!  
  
**Why Data Science?**  
As a young child, I was always interested in how you can apply math to solve everday problems, and my favorite subjects throughout college were statistics, operations research, matrix theory, and calculus. I spent my junior year as an undergraduate researcher working under my Operations Research professor, and that's when I fell in love with research. I discovered data science soon after graduation as I was desparetly looking for a career path that endorsed continual learning. In data science, you get to research and dig into real data to find answers; it also combines my four favorite branches of mathematics. For me, it was a no-brainer.  
  
**What is the purpose of this site?**  
After discovering that this what I wanted, I realized I'd inevitably need to learn how to code. So, in early January of 2020, I wrote my first line of code. I started by taking two open online courses from UC Berkely, but I soon realized that the quickest way I'd learn how to write code would be to use it to research the topics I'm interested in. Thus, I created this web page as a platform to host my journey of learning Python, and data science.
