**and welcome to my "About" page!**  
I am a recent college graduate from The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, I hold a bachelors degree in Actuarial Science, I began teaching myself how to code early January of 2020, and I am an aspiring Data Scientist! I have a genuine passion Mathematics and am particularly interested in recursion, applied statistics, and operations research.  
Although it is indisputable that toning in your math skills and analyzing datasets are two *top-tier passtimes*, some of my other hobbies include fishing, hiking, and leatherworking!  
As I stated above, I only recently began learning how to write code; the purpose of this portfolio is to document my journey.
