**Hello world**, and welcome to my "About" Page! I am a recent college graduate from The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, I hold a bachelors degree in Actuarial Science, I began teaching myself how to code early January of 2020, and I am an aspiring Data Scientist. I genuinenly love the study of Mathematics, but am particularly interested in recursion, applied statistics, and operations research.  
Although it is globally understood that toning in your math skills is a *top-notch-passtime*, I have to admit, I'm a bit of an Outdoorsman as well. Whether it be fishing, hiking, or just simply hanging out on the back deck, I take every oppurtunity I get to clear my head, breathe some fresh air, and photosynthesize!  
I've also been told that I'm quite the hobbiest. The most recent of which being leatherworking, and before that was an online reselling business.  
  
**The sole purpose of this portfolio** is to simply be an outlet for the hobby of mine in which I dream of turning into my career. With that being said, being self-taught can often feel like trying to drink from a water hose, and can be discouraging at times since people tend to post only their best work and harldy ever disclose the journey it took them to get there.  
**Thus, I welcome you to the under-told journey of an aspiring Data Scientist.**
